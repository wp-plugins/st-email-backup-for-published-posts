This plugin emails the admin email account a copy of each post as it gets published.

== Description ==

When enabled, the admin email address gets a message including the title, author, time stamp, category, tags, and content of each post as it gets published. Edits to published posts are also emailed.

Why use this?

*   Keeps the admins aware of all new content
*   Notifications when published posts are modified
*   Enable with just one-click, no hassle
*   No bloat, uses a simple PHP Mail command
*   An extra layer of backup if backups are lost

Notice: This isn't by any means an alternative or replacement for regular database and file backups.

It should email the address listed in the `General Settings` section in the WordPress Dashboard. An email will only be sent out when a new post is published. If you want to perform a quick test, feel free to open an existing post and hit `Update`. A backup email should appear in your inbox shortly.
